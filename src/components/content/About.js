        Growing up I have always been technically minded and have had a passion
        for problem solving. I initially studied film at university, and have
        since worked in various roles within the industry. I found myself
        needing a new challenge, and I sought to gain formal training in
        software by enrolling at General Assembly to immerse myself in web
        development. I am fascinated with how technology intersects with our
        consumption of media and am looking to work in a team that shares the
        same passion. I am interested in all forms of cinema, especially world,
        and I am also an avid collector of physical media.
